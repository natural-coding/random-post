# random-post

Originally it is a blog theme. It shows a random post when user clicks the custom SVG button :-) The site is available at [https://natural-coding.github.io/random-post](https://natural-coding.github.io/random-post)

As getting a random post is like to talk with the Universe :-) such action looks like a meditation. Consequently we should use a little bit of the Indian style on a website. And I did use it. There are yoga man, the Bodhi tree and beautiful color harmonies of the 17th century painters! :-)

The website is fully responsive. There are a couple of SVG-animations here and some JavaScript code.

I would rather use Parcel.js bundler and SASS for creating such a website at the moment.
